# Send-SlackNotification

## SYNOPSIS
Sends a notification to a given Slack webhook

## SYNTAX

### Default (Default)
```
Send-SlackNotification [-Message] <String> [-Webhook] <String> [[-Channel] <String>] [-UpperBlocks <Array>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Attachments
```
Send-SlackNotification [-Message] <String> [-Webhook] <String> [[-Channel] <String>] [-Colour <String>]
 [-Title <String>] [-UpperBlocks <Array>] [-SubBlocks <Array>] [-Fields <Array>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet will send a message to a given Slack webhook, complex messages are formed using the legacy [attachments](https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/attachments) method (though limited support for block kit is supported via the `-UpperBlocks` parameter)

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Simple message
```powershell
Send-SlackNotification -Message "This is a test" -Webhook "https://mywebhook"
```

Would send the message "This is a test" to the given Slack webhook

### Example 2: More complex message
```powershell
Send-SlackNotification -Message "This is a test" -Webhook "https://mywebhook" -Color "#FF0000" -Title "This is a title"
```

This would send the message "This is a test" to the given Slack webhook, the left hand side of the message would feature a red bar and "This is a title" would be displayed in large text at the top of the message

### Example 3: Custom sections
```powershell
$SubBlocks = @(
    @{                                                                                          
        type = "section"
        fields = @(
            @{ 
                type = "mrkdwn"
                text = "Bottom Left?"
            },
            @{
                type = "mrkdwn"
                text = "Bottom Right?"
            }
        )
    }
)
Send-SlackNotification -Message "This is a test" -Webhook "https://mywebhook" -Color "#FF0000" -Title "This is a title" -SubBlocks $SubBlocks
```

In this example we create a set of nested objects containing some additional fields that we wish to append to the message, these are then passed in to the cmdlet with the `-SubBlocks` parameter

## INPUTS

### System.String
### System.Array
## OUTPUTS

### System.Object
## NOTES
This cmdlet currently uses the "attachments" method which has now been deprecated by Slack.  
We can't yet switch over to the full block-kit method as it's lacking colour support which we make heavy use of, once that becomes available we can make the switch though some logic tweaking will be required.
