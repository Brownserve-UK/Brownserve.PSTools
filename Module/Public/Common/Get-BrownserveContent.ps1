.SYNOPSIS
    Wrapper for Get-Content that returns the content in a format that is easier to work with.
.DESCRIPTION
    This cmdlet ensures that any content is returned in a format that is easy to work with in pipelines.
    It stores the content as a string array so it can be easily iterated over while stripping any line breaks.
    It also detects the line endings of the file and stores that information in the returned object so the file can
    be saved with the same line endings.
