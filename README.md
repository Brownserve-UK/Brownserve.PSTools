The tools are packaged as both a NuGet package and PSGallery PowerShell module for easy consumption across a wide variety of projects.
## What's included?
There are various cmdlets/functions that perform a plethora of different tasks, from manipulating changelogs to invoking Terraform plans.  
For a full list see the [module documentation](https://github.com/Brownserve-UK/Brownserve.PSTools/blob/main/.docs/Module/Brownserve.PSTools.md)

## How to use
These tools have been designed for use within Brownserve projects and may have limited use outside of that, however should you wish to include them in your own project take a look at our [guide](https://github.com/Brownserve-UK/Brownserve.PSTools/blob/main/.docs/USING.md)

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome but please do bear in mind that these tools are designed specifically to work in our projects and are used in our production CI/CD pipelines, therefore we may not be able to accommodate all requests.
