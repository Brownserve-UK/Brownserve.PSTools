.SYNOPSIS
    Reads information about the current release from the changelog
.DESCRIPTION
    This task will read the changelog and extract the version history.

        There may be times where our last release was a pre-release but we don't want to select this as our "latest" version.
        For example, say 1.0.0 is our current stable version, but we last released 2.0.0-rc1 so it's at the top of our changelog.
        If we select 2.0.0-rc1 then when we try to promote 2.0.0 to a stable release the version number would get incremented.
        automatically as part of the build (so for example 2.0.0-rc1 -> 2.0.1)
        Also if we had to do an emergency release of the latest stable version (e.g 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0) to patch a security
        issue then we wouldn't want to select our 2.0.0-rc1 pre-release version to base the new patch release off of.
        Therefore we select the last "stable" release which should always be what we want to work with.
        The exception to this is when we're performing a release, in which case we want to use the latest version regardless

.SYNOPSIS
    Sets the correct version number for a release
.DESCRIPTION
    This is done by looking at the last release and determining the next version number based on the type of release
    we're doing.

        Also occasionally we may want to republish a version that we've already released.

.SYNOPSIS
    Updates the modules MALM help
.DESCRIPTION
    PlatyPS will read in the markdown files in the 'Docs' directory and generate a MALM help file for the module.
    This needs to be shipped with the module so that PowerShell can display help for the module, therefore we create it
    in the built module directory.

.SYNOPSIS
    Creates a new branch for staging the release
.DESCRIPTION
    Before we perform a release we need to ensure the changelog and help files are updated.
    As we can't push to the main branch we need to create a new branch to stage the release and submit a PR.
    This is helpful as we can review everything before we actually release it.
    The branch name is determined by the version number.
    For example if we're releasing version 1.0.0 then the branch name will be 'release/1.0.0'

    Dependent tasks will be run in the order they're defined.
    !! BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE ORDERING !!
#>

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Meta task for building the module.
.DESCRIPTION
    This task will run all the tasks required to build just the module.
    It doesn't build the documentation, NuGet package or perform any tests.
    This task is mostly here just to serve as a base for other tasks.
#>
task Build UseWorkingCopy, CreateModuleManifest, {}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Meta task for building the module and importing it.
.DESCRIPTION
    This task will run all the tasks required to build the module and import it.
    It does not build the documentation, NuGet package or perform any tests as these can take some time to complete.
    This task is best used when developing new features locally as it allows you to quickly test your changes
    interactively.
#>
task BuildAndImport Build, ImportModule, {}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Meta task for building the module along with the documentation.
.DESCRIPTION
    This task will run all the tasks required to build the module and generate the documentation.
    The documentation can take some time to generate, especially as it currently requires us to run a separate process
    to replace the line endings and format the markdown.
    This task is best ran after any local changes have largely been finalised as it will generate any documentation
    required.
#>
task BuildWithDocs BuildAndImport, CreateModuleHelp, {}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Meta task for building and testing the module.
.DESCRIPTION
    This task performs the same actions as the previous tasks but also performs unit tests on the module.
    This task is best used to thoroughly test any changes before committing them.
#>
task BuildAndTest BuildWithDocs, Tests, {}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Meta task for building and testing the module, then finally confirming there are no uncommitted changes.
.DESCRIPTION
    This task will build the module, perform unit tests on it and then ensure there are no uncommitted changes
    resulting from the build.
    This is the build we use for our pull_request CI pipeline and as such must pass before we can merge any changes.
#>
task BuildTestAndCheck BuildAndTest, CheckForUncommittedChanges, {}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Meta task that prepares the module for release.
.DESCRIPTION
    This task will update the changelog and module documentation with the new version, commit those changes to a
    new branch and then create a pull request for merging the changes into the default branch.
    This allows us to review the changes and make any adjustments before we actually release them.
    We use this task in the stage_release CI pipeline.

}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Meta task that performs a release of the module.
.DESCRIPTION
    For a release the module is built, tested and then published to the various endpoints.
    Unlike other tasks the version number is not updated as part of the build as we expect it to already be set in the
    changelog.
    We use this task in the release CI pipeline.
